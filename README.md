Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Game Room client wants to develop a web-based version of their Android game Draw It or Lose It. This game has teams compete by guessing what has been drawn by the application rendering. The Game Room has requested that we set up an environment for this web-based game.  

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel I did great at writing the executive summary, design constraints, and domain model. I feel that I truly got what was need for the job written in a way that anyone could understand what was needed and what can be done for this job.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found when developing the code, the domain model along side the UML diagram help me write the code for this project.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could go back and change anything I would go back and change how I wrote the evaluation and add more detail on the uses for this type of server.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When creating the software design, I looked at the constraints of project then looked at the needs of the client and choose what was best for the job and meet all constraints. It is important to consider the client’s needs because they are who you work for if it does not fit there needs then its not right for the job meaning they do not want it or need it.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When designing the software my approach was using the UML diagram to write the program so that it fit the result I needed for the program. The techniques I always use for problems like this is step through the project one line at a time.
